# Introduction
This dataset captures detailed sales transactions from multiple locations in New York City, specifically Astoria, Lower Manhattan and Hell's Kitchen, during January-June 2023. It provides a comprehensive record of purchases across various product categories, including beverages like coffee, tea, and drinking chocolate, as well as bakery items such as scones and biscotti.
# Data Source
The dataset was sourced through a structured survey conducted across selected store locations in New York City, including Astoria, Lower Manhattan and Hell's Kitchen. The survey results were documented in an Excel spreadsheet before it was imported into Power BI for advanced data cleaning, transformation, visualization and analysis. The transition from Excel to Power BI allowed for more dynamic insights, enabling the identification of sales trends, customer behavior patterns, and performance differences between store locations.
# Tools
1. Data Sourcing and Importing:   
o	Successfully importing raw data from Excel into Power BI, ensuring a seamless transition for further analysis.
3.	Data Cleaning and Transformation using DAX:
o	Utilizing DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) functions within Power BI to perform essential data cleaning and transformation tasks.
o	Adding new calculated columns for metrics such as revenue, month, day, and time extraction, which are crucial for detailed analysis.
o	Ensuring data accuracy and consistency through these transformations, preparing the dataset for insightful reporting.
4.	Measure Creation and Calculation:
o	Developing new measures using DAX to calculate key performance indicators, including total revenue and total quantity sold.
o	Demonstrating the ability to distinguish between explicit measures (calculated fields) and implicit measures (automatically generated by Power BI) to tailor analysis to specific needs.
5.	Data Visualization:
o	Designing and implementing visualizations that effectively communicate insights derived from the dataset.
## Data Cleaning and Transformation
The process of data cleaning and transformation is crucial to ensure that the dataset is accurate, consistent, and ready for analysis. For the given dataset, which was imported from Excel into Power BI, the following steps outline the cleaning and transformation process:
1. Data Cleaning:
•	Handling Missing Values:
o	Review the dataset for any missing or null values in key columns, such as transaction date, transaction qty, product id, and unit price.
•	Data Type Correction:
o	Ensure that each column has the correct data type. For instance, transaction date should be formatted as a date, transaction qty as an integer, and unit price as a decimal. This is essential for accurate calculations and analyses.
•	Removing Duplicates:
o	Check for and remove any duplicate records that may distort the analysis. Duplicate entries can occur due to errors in data entry or processing.
•	Consistency Checks:
o	Ensure consistency in data entries, especially in categorical columns like store location and product type. For example, ensure that all instances of "Lower Manhattan" are spelled the same way and have the same case format.
2. Data Transformation:
•	Adding Calculated Columns:
o	Use DAX functions in Power BI to create new columns that provide additional insights:
	Revenue Calculation: Create a Revenue column that multiplies transaction_qty by unit_price to determine the total revenue for each transaction.
Revenue = [transaction_qty] * [unit_price]
•	Extracting Date Components: Create new columns for Month, Day, and Time by extracting these components from the transaction_date column:
Month Number = MONTH([transaction_date]) 
Day of the week = WEEKDAY([transaction_date])
 Transaction hour = Hour([transaction_time])
•	Converting Month Number to Month Name:
Convert the MonthNumber into a MonthName using the FORMAT() function:
MonthName = FORMAT([transaction_date], "MMMM")
•	Creating New Measures:
Develop new measures to calculate key metrics such as Total Revenue and Total Quantity sold:
Total Revenue = SUMX(Sales, [transaction_qty] * [unit_price]) 
Total Quantity = SUM(Sales[transaction_qty])
•	Standardizing Formats and Units:
o	Ensure that all currency values are consistently formatted and that units (such as quantity) are standardized across the dataset.
3. Implementation of Explicit and Implicit Measures:
•	Explicit Measures:
o	Define explicit measures using DAX to perform specific calculations that will be used across various visualizations. These measures provide consistent results across different contexts within Power BI.
•	Implicit Measures:
o	Use implicit measures, which are automatically generated by Power BI when dragging and dropping fields into visualizations. These are useful for quick calculations but should be verified for consistency.
By performing these data cleaning and transformation steps, the dataset becomes more reliable and ready for insightful analysis. The clean and well-structured data facilitates the creation of accurate visualizations and supports informed decision-making based on the analysis conducted in Power BI. This preparation also ensures that subsequent analysis, whether it be sales trends, customer behavior, or performance metrics, is built on a solid foundation.
